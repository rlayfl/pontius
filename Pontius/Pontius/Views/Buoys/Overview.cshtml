<li>Ultimate origin of buoys is unknown.</li>
<li>1295: Seaman's manual refers to navigation buoys in the Guadalquivir River, Spain.</li>
<li>Early medieval mentions of buoys in the French / Belgian River Maas.</li>
<li>1358: Record of a barrel buoy in the Dutch Maasmond (Maas Sluis / Maasgat).</li>
<li>Early buoys:
<ul>
<li>Likely timber beams or rafts</li>
<li>Barrel buoy was difficult to secure to seabed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Development of conical tonne buoy:
<ul>
<li>Solid plug at narrow end</li>
<li>Mooring ring attachment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By 1790: Nun buoy replaces older conical tonne:
<ul>
<li>Conical section below waterline</li>
<li>Barrel shape at waterline</li>
<li>Truncated cone above water</li>
<li>Completed with a top mark</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>19th century: Iron buoys introduced:
<ul>
<li>Watertight internal bulkheads</li>
<li>Topmarks</li>
<li>Bells (from 1860)</li>
<li>Whistles (from 1880)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1879: Julius Pintsch patents compressed gas illumination for buoys.</li>
<li>1912 onwards: Gustaf Dalén's acetylene lamp replaces gas system:
<ul>
<li>Could be set to flash</li>
<li>Distinguishes buoys from ships' lights and each other</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Later development: Sun valve shuts off gas during daylight.</li>
</ul>";
